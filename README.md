> This project is a two steps registration pipeline that aims to register brain segmentation masks from the MNI template space to the patient PET(Positron Emission Tomography) image space. First, the MNI template is registered to the patient space. The transformation matrix that was used to register the template to the patient space is saved in an output folder. The transformation matrix is then applied to the brain segmentation masks. The process is repeted for every subject. All the files generated by the sccripts are saved in the ouput folder specified in the main function.
